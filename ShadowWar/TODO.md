Sub-factions need to be handled better:
    Guard - Cadians, Catachans, Steel Legion
    Orks - Goffs, Blood Axes, Deathskulls, Evil Sunz, Bad Moons, Snakebites
    Marines - Sons of Guilliman, Blood Angels, Salamanders, White Scars, Space Wolves (the only special rules one), Angels of Redemption

Craftworld Eldar Heavy Weapons Platform is not implemented correctly
Grey Knight Gunner is not implemented correctly (weapon replacement)
Tyranid required weapons are not implemented correctly
